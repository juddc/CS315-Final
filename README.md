CS315-Final

For our final project, we are going to be working in webGL on a game that would combine both pong and breakout. The game would be setup similar to pong, with two players with paddles on opposing sides of the field. Each player would start with a ball, which could be bounced off the paddles and onto the blocks to break them. The first player to make a ball pass over them wins. Our project would be functionally 2d, but it would 'look' 3d. Light would be cast on the paddles and the ball which would create shadows on the playing field.
